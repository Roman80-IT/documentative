## a what?

when building your web app, there are 4 main data sets you deal with.

- visible / the html being displayed
- script / any javascript variables you may wish to update
- client-stored / anything persisted on the client side (e.g. localStorage)
- server-stored / data gained from interactions with the server.

sear doesn't touch anything to do with the server. there're so many ways data
transfer between the server and client can be implemented, that's best left to you.

the other 3? sear takes them all, and gives one single object to interact with
(from above, script data). you update data within that object, and the other two
(visible + client-stored) reactively update accordingly (if necessary).

this can massively simplify web app development when used to its fully potential,
enabling (once initialised) you to do in only a couple of lines what you may once
have needed to write 20 for.

why should you use this when there are so many other libraries out there promising
similar things, all of which seem to have massive amounts of support behind them?
all depends on your use case. they had many things i didn't need nor want, and lacked
other things i did (without having to install extra libraries). so, i spent ~50 hours
of my time building something simple but powerful. this doesn't come with the complexities
of constructing multiple components on the server-side and then learning an extensive api
to fit everything together. it comes with functionality that does the job without trying
to do any more.

if you do want something like that, check out [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) or
[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). otherwise, give this a try. it has some decent
capabilities, and does the job well enough.

## docs / features

(to see these in action, go to [the website](https://dragonwocky.me/sear/))

### app declaration

include the file! either download the file from [here](https://github.com/dragonwocky/sear/releases/download/v0.5.5/sear.0.5.5.js)
and include in your own assets, or source it from `https://dragonwocky.me/sear/sear.min.js`. To access a specific version, use `https://dragonwocky.me/sear/dist/sear.<version-number>.js` (replacing `<version-number>` with e.g. `0.5.5`).

```html
<script src="https://dragonwocky.me/sear/sear.min.js"></script>
```

initialise.

```js
const app = new Sear({
  /*
   * whatever element you want to restrict this to
   * [type] single ID as a string
   * [default] document.body
   */
  el: '#app',

  format: {
    /*
     * persist app data (see below: client) to localStorage under this name
     * [default] none (doesn't persist)
     */
    name: 'Sear/Demo',
    /*
     * version of the data structure
     * [type] string or number
     * [default] none (won't check)
     */
    version: 1,
    /*
     * run this handler if version (above) doesn't match
     * with the persisted data structure version
     * [args] old (outdated data found in localStorage), version (of outdated data)
     * [default] return {}; (starts afresh)
     */
    handler(old, version) {
      return {};
    }
  },

  /*
   * any reactive data properties (inc. computed properties)
   */
  // data will return to defaults on page reload
  data: {
    example: 0,
    // client data will be persisted to and fetched from localStorage
    //  -> only works if format.name is defined
    //  -> (otherwise will act like normal data)
    client: {}
  },

  // any functions watching for changes to data
  watch: {}
});

// returns the following
{ example: 0, client: {} };
```

#### properties

basic properties can be objects, arrays, dates, strings, numbers, and boolean values.

```js
data.client: {
  selected: 'purple',
  icecream: {
    flavours: ['berry', 'watermelon', '<b>tiramisu</b>']
  }
};
```

these can be updated like any normal object property, or added in later.

```js
app['client'].user.selected = 'green';
app['client'].icecream.new = '';
app['client'].paragraph = `this is <b>bold</b>.
  this is <i>italicised</i>.
  but i? i am <s>struck out</s>.`;
```

computed properties are functions that can return a dynamic value
and can access fellow properties via `this`. these must not be declared
as arrow functions! (arrow functions break persistence and accessing `this`)

> to access a computed value,
> use `app.value` rather than `app.value()`.

```js
data: {
  redselected() {
    return this['client']selected === 'red';
  },
  colour () {
    return 'color: ' + this['client'].selected;
  }
}
```

#### watchers

a watcher function will be evaluated whenever its corresponding data
prop is changed. an argument is passed to it with the previous value of that data.

> due to the way the observation system works,
> watchers for properties within objects are declared by `'parent.child'(prev) {}`
> rather than `parent: { child(prev) {} }`.
> this allows for watching objects and their properties separately.

```js
watch: {
  'client.selected'(prev) {
    console.log(
      `[watcher] selected colour has changed from ${prev} to ${this['client'].selected}`
    );
  },
  'client.icecream.flavours'(prev) {
    const flavours = [...this['client'].icecream.flavours]
      .filter(flavour => {
        if (prev.includes(flavour)) {
          prev.splice(prev.indexOf(flavour), 1);
          return false;
        }
        return true;
      });
    if (flavours.length) {
      console.log(`[watcher] flavour(s) added: <<${flavours.join('>> <<')}>>`);
    } else if (prev.length)
      console.log(`[watcher] flavour(s) removed: <<${prev.join('>> <<')}>>`);
  }
}
```

### reactive binding

#### :html

sync the contents of the bound element to a data property.
contents will be displayed as HTML.

> not recommended (unless for e.g. displaying parsed markdown).
> dynamically rendering untrusted or user-input content could lead to
> XSS attacks (or other unintended consequences).

```html
<p :html="client.paragraph"></p>
```

#### :text

sync the contents of the bound element to a data property.
contents will be displayed as plain text.

```html
<p :text="client.paragraph"></p>
```

#### {{ moustache }}

text binding can also be done via `{{ moustache }}` tags.

> use only in text nodes. use in attributes etc. will make weird things happen.

```html
<p>{{ client.paragraph }}</p>
```

#### :value

sync the value of the bound input to a data property.
works for any input (e.g. text, checkbox, select, you name it).

```html
<textarea :value="client.paragraph"></textarea>

<select :value="client.selected">
  <option value="red">red</option>
  <option value="blue">blue</option>
  <option value="green">green</option>
  <option value="purple">purple</option>
</select>
```

#### :unbound

use if you want something to be initially populated with a value,
but not reactively updated.

```html
<p>
  <b>initial paragraph (as of page load):</b>
  <span :text="client.paragraph" :unbound></span>
</p>
```

#### :pre

use if you want to preserve everything within that tag -
content will not be modified/updated in any way.

```html
<p :pre>these {{ tags }} will <span :text="client.paragraph">not</span> be parsed!</p>
```

#### :each

repeat an element for each value of an array.
assign this attribute to a container, and the first child will be the one
repeated within the container.

to access the relevant index/id (starting from 1) use `[[:each:id]]` and
to access the current value use `[[:each:value]]`.
if the value should be parsed as html (e.g. for displaying markdown), use `[[:each:value:html]]`.

```html
<div :each="client.icecream.flavours">
  <p><i>[[:each:id]]</i>. [[:each:value]]</p>
  <button onclick="app['client'].icecream.flavours.splice([[:each:id]] - 1, 1)">
    delete
  </button>
</div>
```

> extra snippet! to add something to the list, use the following js
> (assuming you've bound an input via `:value="icecream.new"`):
>
> ```js
> if (app['client']icecream.new) {
>   app['client']icecream.flavours = [app['client']icecream.new, ...app['client']icecream.flavours];
>   app['client']icecream.new = '';
> }
> ```

#### :if / :else

with `:if`, the element will only be present on the page if the
relevant prop has a truthy value.

with `:else`, the element will only be present on the page if the
relevant prop has a falsy value.

```html
<p>
  <b>is red selected?</b>
  <span :if="client.redselected">yes it is</span>
  <span :else="client.redselected">no it isn't</span>
</p>
```

#### :bind:attr

use to reactively update/bind any attribute value.

values are separated by spaces, written as `condition=response`.
if there is no `response`, it will be assumed to be the value of `condition`.

if the attribute is boolean, then a truthy `condition` will result in the
presence of the attribute. a falsy `condition` will result in the removal of
the attribute. to inverse this, do `condition=false`.

> this is only 1 way (it does not sync).
> for the `checked` attribute of checkboxes, use `:value` instead.

```html
<p>
  <input type="checkbox" :bind:disabled="client.redselected=false" disabled />
  <span>(will be disabled if red is not selected)</span>
</p>

<p :bind:style="colour">i'm {{ client.selected }}</p>
```

# Skink

A multi-purpose [Discord](https://discordapp.com) bot built with [Eris](https://abal.moe/Eris).

- A set of base features and configuration/customisation abilities.
- Separate sets (and prefixes) for moderation and general commands (the bot will also respond to mentions for the latter).
- A few extra fun features, including cleverbot implementation: chat in DMs or with a command.
- A basic economy system to allow for future features that will make use of the currency.

_These commands can only be run by users with the `ADMINISTRATOR` permission or users with the role set by the `mod` command._

#### Required Permissions

- `readMessages`, `sendMessages`, `embedLinks` & `addReactions`: for responding to commands.

#### Feature Ideas (aka TODO list)

- Rooms: when enabled by mods, users can run `room` and create a channel in a set category named after them, having complete moderation over that channel.
- Voting system: round 1, register by voting; round 2, optionally change vote (if wanting to vote for winners).
- Games: Hangman, Noughts & Crosses, Connect4, Battles.
- Mod logging.
- Tags (custom commands).
- Selfranks (support for adding by reaction)
- Ranks/experience system. Including decay, roles based on position not just level, maybe way to "battle" other users for their xp?
- Starboard (add x starred msgs to x channel).
- Pets.

### Known Issues

- Cleverbot responds slowly.
- Only up to 99 messages can be pruned each time.
- Custom user prefixes are global, not per-server. Is this good or bad?

### Contributing

If you notice any bugs, please open an issue with information about what happened (or what didn't happen) and why (what you tried to do and how you tried to do it). Contributions in the form of pull requests for new features or improvements to existing features are welcome.

# backbone

A modular bot template for [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/). Before building a bot from this, you should have a fairly decent grasp of [JavaScript](https://www.google.com.eg/search?q=javascript) (it's possible to create a bot without it, but frustrating and slow).

For anything that isn't covered by this, have a look at the [Discord Developer Documentation](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro) and the [discord.js docs](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome). The [Discord.js Guide](https://discordjs.guide/#/) and [An Idiot's Guide](https://anidiots.guide/) are both good resources too.

Backbone is licensed under the MIT License (see the LICENSE file).

### Ready to start making a bot out of Backbone? Have a look at [the wiki](https://github.com/TheDragonRing/backbone/wiki) to learn how to set it up and add features!

Seriously, go check it out. It has everything from creating the bot user to using the database and adding Cleverbot functionality.

# Sear

a lightweight, reactive data system

## a what?

when building your web app, there are 4 main data sets you deal with.

- visible / the html being displayed
- script / any javascript variables you may wish to update
- client-stored / anything persisted on the client side (e.g. localStorage)
- server-stored / data gained from interactions with the server.

sear doesn't touch anything to do with the server. there're so many ways data
transfer between the server and client can be implemented, that's best left to you.

the other 3? sear takes them all, and gives one single object to interact with
(from above, script data). you update data within that object, and the other two
(visible + client-stored) reactively update accordingly (if necessary).

this can massively simplify web app development when used to its fully potential,
enabling (once initialised) you to do in only a couple of lines what you may once
have needed to write 20 for.

why should you use this when there are so many other libraries out there promising
similar things, all of which seem to have massive amounts of support behind them?
all depends on your use case. they had many things i didn't need nor want, and lacked
other things i did (without having to install extra libraries). so, i spent ~50 hours
of my time building something simple but powerful. this doesn't come with the complexities
of constructing multiple components on the server-side and then learning an extensive api
to fit everything together. it comes with functionality that does the job without trying
to do any more.

if you do want something like that, check out [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) or
[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). otherwise, give this a try. it has some decent
capabilities, and does the job well enough.

## docs / features

(to see these in action, go to [the website](https://dragonwocky.me/sear/))

#### app declaration

include the file! either download the file from [here](https://github.com/dragonwocky/sear/releases/download/v0.5.5/sear.0.5.5.js)
and include in your own assets, or source it from `https://dragonwocky.me/sear/sear.min.js`. To access a specific version, use `https://dragonwocky.me/sear/dist/sear.<version-number>.js` (replacing `<version-number>` with e.g. `0.5.5`).

```html
<script src="https://dragonwocky.me/sear/sear.min.js"></script>
```

initialise.

```js
const app = new Sear({
  /*
   * whatever element you want to restrict this to
   * [type] single ID as a string
   * [default] document.body
   */
  el: '#app',

  format: {
    /*
     * persist app data (see below: client) to localStorage under this name
     * [default] none (doesn't persist)
     */
    name: 'Sear/Demo',
    /*
     * version of the data structure
     * [type] string or number
     * [default] none (won't check)
     */
    version: 1,
    /*
     * run this handler if version (above) doesn't match
     * with the persisted data structure version
     * [args] old (outdated data found in localStorage), version (of outdated data)
     * [default] return {}; (starts afresh)
     */
    handler(old, version) {
      return {};
    }
  },

  /*
   * any reactive data properties (inc. computed properties)
   */
  // data will return to defaults on page reload
  data: {
    example: 0,
    // client data will be persisted to and fetched from localStorage
    //  -> only works if format.name is defined
    //  -> (otherwise will act like normal data)
    client: {}
  },

  // any functions watching for changes to data
  watch: {}
});

// returns the following
{ example: 0, client: {} };
```

#### properties

basic properties can be objects, arrays, dates, strings, numbers, and boolean values.

```js
data.client: {
  selected: 'purple',
  icecream: {
    flavours: ['berry', 'watermelon', '<b>tiramisu</b>']
  }
};
```

these can be updated like any normal object property, or added in later.

```js
app['client'].user.selected = 'green';
app['client'].icecream.new = '';
app['client'].paragraph = `this is <b>bold</b>.
  this is <i>italicised</i>.
  but i? i am <s>struck out</s>.`;
```

computed properties are functions that can return a dynamic value
and can access fellow properties via `this`. these must not be declared
as arrow functions! (arrow functions break persistence and accessing `this`)

> to access a computed value,
> use `app.value` rather than `app.value()`.

```js
data: {
  redselected() {
    return this['client']selected === 'red';
  },
  colour () {
    return 'color: ' + this['client'].selected;
  }
}
```

#### watchers

a watcher function will be evaluated whenever its corresponding data
prop is changed. an argument is passed to it with the previous value of that data.

> due to the way the observation system works,
> watchers for properties within objects are declared by `'parent.child'(prev) {}`
> rather than `parent: { child(prev) {} }`.
> this allows for watching objects and their properties separately.

```js
watch: {
  'client.selected'(prev) {
    console.log(
      `[watcher] selected colour has changed from ${prev} to ${this['client'].selected}`
    );
  },
  'client.icecream.flavours'(prev) {
    const flavours = [...this['client'].icecream.flavours]
      .filter(flavour => {
        if (prev.includes(flavour)) {
          prev.splice(prev.indexOf(flavour), 1);
          return false;
        }
        return true;
      });
    if (flavours.length) {
      console.log(`[watcher] flavour(s) added: <<${flavours.join('>> <<')}>>`);
    } else if (prev.length)
      console.log(`[watcher] flavour(s) removed: <<${prev.join('>> <<')}>>`);
  }
}
```

### reactive binding

#### :html

sync the contents of the bound element to a data property.
contents will be displayed as HTML.

> not recommended (unless for e.g. displaying parsed markdown).
> dynamically rendering untrusted or user-input content could lead to
> XSS attacks (or other unintended consequences).

```html
<p :html="client.paragraph"></p>
```

#### :text

sync the contents of the bound element to a data property.
contents will be displayed as plain text.

```html
<p :text="client.paragraph"></p>
```

#### {{ moustache }}

text binding can also be done via `{{ moustache }}` tags.

> use only in text nodes. use in attributes etc. will make weird things happen.

```html
<p>{{ client.paragraph }}</p>
```

#### :value

sync the value of the bound input to a data property.
works for any input (e.g. text, checkbox, select, you name it).

```html
<textarea :value="client.paragraph"></textarea>

<select :value="client.selected">
  <option value="red">red</option>
  <option value="blue">blue</option>
  <option value="green">green</option>
  <option value="purple">purple</option>
</select>
```

#### :unbound

use if you want something to be initially populated with a value,
but not reactively updated.

```html
<p>
  <b>initial paragraph (as of page load):</b>
  <span :text="client.paragraph" :unbound></span>
</p>
```

#### :pre

use if you want to preserve everything within that tag -
content will not be modified/updated in any way.

```html
<p :pre>these {{ tags }} will <span :text="client.paragraph">not</span> be parsed!</p>
```

#### :each

repeat an element for each value of an array.
assign this attribute to a container, and the first child will be the one
repeated within the container.

to access the relevant index/id (starting from 1) use `[[:each:id]]` and
to access the current value use `[[:each:value]]`.
if the value should be parsed as html (e.g. for displaying markdown), use `[[:each:value:html]]`.

```html
<div :each="client.icecream.flavours">
  <p><i>[[:each:id]]</i>. [[:each:value]]</p>
  <button onclick="app['client'].icecream.flavours.splice([[:each:id]] - 1, 1)">
    delete
  </button>
</div>
```

> extra snippet! to add something to the list, use the following js
> (assuming you've bound an input via `:value="icecream.new"`):
>
> ```js
> if (app['client']icecream.new) {
>   app['client']icecream.flavours = [app['client']icecream.new, ...app['client']icecream.flavours];
>   app['client']icecream.new = '';
> }
> ```

#### :if / :else

with `:if`, the element will only be present on the page if the
relevant prop has a truthy value.

with `:else`, the element will only be present on the page if the
relevant prop has a falsy value.

```html
<p>
  <b>is red selected?</b>
  <span :if="client.redselected">yes it is</span>
  <span :else="client.redselected">no it isn't</span>
</p>
```

#### :bind:attr

use to reactively update/bind any attribute value.

values are separated by spaces, written as `condition=response`.
if there is no `response`, it will be assumed to be the value of `condition`.

if the attribute is boolean, then a truthy `condition` will result in the
presence of the attribute. a falsy `condition` will result in the removal of
the attribute. to inverse this, do `condition=false`.

> this is only 1 way (it does not sync).
> for the `checked` attribute of checkboxes, use `:value` instead.

```html
<p>
  <input type="checkbox" :bind:disabled="client.redselected=false" disabled />
  <span>(will be disabled if red is not selected)</span>
</p>

<p :bind:style="colour">i'm {{ client.selected }}</p>
```

# Skink

A multi-purpose [Discord](https://discordapp.com) bot built with [Eris](https://abal.moe/Eris).

- A set of base features and configuration/customisation abilities.
- Separate sets (and prefixes) for moderation and general commands (the bot will also respond to mentions for the latter).
- A few extra fun features, including cleverbot implementation: chat in DMs or with a command.
- A basic economy system to allow for future features that will make use of the currency.

#### Feature Ideas (aka TODO list)

- Rooms: when enabled by mods, users can run `room` and create a channel in a set category named after them, having complete moderation over that channel.
- Voting system: round 1, register by voting; round 2, optionally change vote (if wanting to vote for winners).
- Games: Hangman, Noughts & Crosses, Connect4, Battles.
- Mod logging.
- Tags (custom commands).
- Selfranks (support for adding by reaction)
- Ranks/experience system. Including decay, roles based on position not just level, maybe way to "battle" other users for their xp?
- Starboard (add x starred msgs to x channel).
- Pets.

### Known Issues

- Cleverbot responds slowly.
- Only up to 99 messages can be pruned each time.
- Custom user prefixes are global, not per-server. Is this good or bad?

### Contributing

  $utils {
    flatten(...arr) = // recursively merges arrays to remove depth
    join(array, char = ', ', word) = // (['a', 'b', 'c'], ', ', ', and ') =>  'a, b, and c'
    line(string, char = '=', where) = // 0: both, 1: top, 2: bottom
    async walk(dir, list = []) = // recusively read directory contents

# backbone

A modular bot template for [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/). Before building a bot from this, you should have a fairly decent grasp of [JavaScript](https://www.google.com.eg/search?q=javascript) (it's possible to create a bot without it, but frustrating and slow).

For anything that isn't covered by this, have a look at the [Discord Developer Documentation](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro) and the [discord.js docs](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome). The [Discord.js Guide](https://discordjs.guide/#/) and [An Idiot's Guide](https://anidiots.guide/) are both good resources too.

### Ready to start making a bot out of Backbone? Have a look at [the wiki](https://github.com/TheDragonRing/backbone/wiki) to learn how to set it up and add features!

Seriously, go check it out. It has everything from creating the bot user to using the database and adding Cleverbot functionality.
